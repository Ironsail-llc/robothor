"""
Base consumer class for event bus stream processing.

Provides common lifecycle management, signal handling, and error recovery.
Subclasses override `handle()` to process events.

Usage:
    class MyConsumer(BaseConsumer):
        stream = "email"
        group = "email-pipeline"
        consumer_name = "worker-1"

        def handle(self, event: dict) -> None:
            print(event["type"], event["payload"])

        MyConsumer().run()
