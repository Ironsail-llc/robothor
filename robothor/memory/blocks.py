"""
Agent memory blocks — named persistent text blocks for structured working memory.

Provides read/write/list operations against the agent_memory_blocks table.
Used by the MCP server to expose memory_block_read/write/list tools.

Usage:
    from robothor.memory.blocks import read_block, write_block, list_blocks

    block = read_block("persona")
    write_block("working_context", "Current task: ...")
    all_blocks = list_blocks()
