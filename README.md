## Highlights

**Platform** — Declarative YAML manifests for every agent. A workflow engine with conditional branching. 74 registered tools with per-agent allow/deny lists. Redis Streams event bus with consumer groups and RBAC.

**The Helm** — Not a dashboard, a control plane. Next.js 16 + Dockview with 20 lazy-loaded components. Chat with agents, manage tasks on a Kanban board, watch event streams in real time, monitor service health. Fully extensible component registry.

**Intelligence** — Three-tier memory (working, short-term with TTL, long-term with semantic search). Knowledge graph that grows autonomously. Local RAG stack with embeddings, reranking, and generation. Facts have confidence scores, categories, and lifecycle states — they decay, strengthen, supersede, and consolidate on their own.

**Physical** — YOLOv8 nano + InsightFace ArcFace, loaded once at startup. Three runtime modes: disarmed, basic (motion-triggered smart detection), armed (per-frame tracking). Any RTSP camera. Pluggable alert targets. Scene analysis via vision LLM. All local, no cloud.

**Operations** — Built-in CRM with cross-channel identity resolution and multi-tenancy. Task state machine (TODO &rarr; IN_PROGRESS &rarr; REVIEW &rarr; DONE) with SLA tracking and agent notifications. MCP server exposes 57 tools over stdio. Encrypted secrets (SOPS + age), systemd services, Cloudflare tunnel, self-healing watchdogs.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ironsail-llc/robothor.git
cd robothor
pip install -e ".[all]"
robothor init       # Interactive setup: DB, Redis, Ollama, migrations
robothor serve      # Start orchestrator + engine
```

Or with Docker for dependencies:

```bash
robothor init --docker   # PostgreSQL+pgvector, Redis, Ollama in containers
robothor serve
```

Engine and TUI commands:

```bash
robothor engine status   # Engine health, scheduler, bot status
robothor engine run <id> # Run any agent manually
robothor tui             # Terminal dashboard for monitoring
```

## Build Your Agents

Every agent is defined by a YAML manifest and an optional instruction file. Scaffold one, or drop a manifest in `docs/agents/` yourself.

```bash
robothor agent scaffold support-triage --description "Classify incoming support tickets"
```

This creates `docs/agents/support-triage.yaml` (manifest) and `brain/SUPPORT_TRIAGE.md` (instruction file) from templates. Edit them to fit your needs:

```yaml
# docs/agents/support-triage.yaml
id: support-triage
name: Support Triage
description: Classify incoming support tickets and route to the right team
version: "2026-03-01"
department: operations

model:
  primary: openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5
  fallbacks:
    - openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6
    - gemini/gemini-2.5-pro

schedule:
  cron: "*/30 8-20 * * 1-5"
  timezone: America/New_York
  timeout_seconds: 300
  max_iterations: 15
  session_target: isolated

delivery:
  mode: none              # Silent worker — no user-facing output

# Event hooks — primary trigger path (cron serves as safety net)
hooks:
  - stream: support
    event_type: ticket.new
    message: "New support ticket received. Classify and route."

tools_allowed:
  - exec
  - read_file
  - write_file
  - search_memory
  - create_task
  - list_tasks
  - resolve_task
tools_denied:
  - delete_task

task_protocol: true       # Must follow: list_my_tasks → process → resolve
status_file: brain/memory/support-triage-status.md
instruction_file: brain/SUPPORT_TRIAGE.md
bootstrap_files:
  - brain/AGENTS.md
  - brain/TOOLS.md

downstream_agents:
  - support-engineer
  - account-manager
tags_produced: [support, routing, escalation]
```

### Contracts

Agents are built against two strict contracts:

| Contract | File | Enforced by |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Manifest schema | `docs/agents/schema.yaml` | `validate_agents.py`, pre-commit hook, engine startup |
| Instruction format | `docs/agents/INSTRUCTION_CONTRACT.md` | Convention (AI-readable) |

Required manifest fields: `id` (kebab-case), `name`, `description`, `version` (YYYY-MM-DD), `department`.

### Manifest Fields

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `model.primary` / `fallbacks` | LLM with ordered fallback chain. Broken models auto-removed per run. |
| `schedule.cron` | APScheduler cron expression. Leave empty for hook-only agents. |
| `delivery.mode` | `announce` (delivers to user) or `none` (silent worker). |
| `tools_allowed` / `tools_denied` | Per-agent tool access. The engine strips tools not in the allow list before sending to the LLM. |
| `hooks` | Event triggers from Redis Streams. Primary fast path; cron as safety net. |
| `task_protocol` | Agent must check its inbox, process tasks, and resolve them. |
| `warmup.context_files` | Files pre-loaded into context before each run. |
| `streams.read` / `write` | Redis Streams the agent can subscribe to or publish on. |
| `instruction_file` | Markdown file loaded as the system prompt. |
| `bootstrap_files` | Shared context files appended after instructions. |
| `downstream_agents` | Agents this one creates tasks for. |
| `sla` | Response time targets by priority level. |
| `review_workflow` | If true, tasks go to REVIEW for supervisor approval. |

Full schema: [schema.yaml](docs/agents/schema.yaml) | Reference: [Agent Playbook](docs/agents/PLAYBOOK.md)

### Agent Lifecycle

```bash
robothor engine list           # See all scheduled agents
robothor engine run <id>       # Run one manually
robothor engine history        # Recent runs with status and duration
python scripts/validate_agents.py --agent <id>  # Validate manifest
```

The engine provides **74 tools** — CRM operations, memory search, file I/O, shell execution, web fetch, task coordination, and more. Each agent sees only the tools in its `tools_allowed` list.

## Workflows

Multi-step pipelines defined in YAML. Triggered by events, backed by cron safety nets.

```yaml
# docs/workflows/support-pipeline.yaml
id: support-pipeline
name: Support Pipeline
description: Triage tickets, then route to engineer or account manager

triggers:
  - type: hook
    stream: support
    event_type: ticket.new
  - type: cron
    cron: "0 9-17/4 * * 1-5"

steps:
  - id: triage
    type: agent
    agent_id: support-triage
    message: "New ticket received. Classify and route."
    on_failure: abort

  - id: check_priority
    type: condition
    input: "{{ steps.triage.output_text }}"
    branches:
      - when: "'escalation' in value.lower()"
        goto: escalate
      - when: "'technical' in value.lower()"
        goto: engineer
      - otherwise: true
        goto: done

  - id: escalate
    type: agent
    agent_id: account-manager
    message: "High-priority ticket escalated. Review and respond."

  - id: engineer
    type: agent
    agent_id: support-engineer
    message: "Technical ticket assigned. Investigate and resolve."

  - id: done
    type: noop
```

**Event hooks** on Redis Streams are the primary trigger. Cron schedules serve as safety nets at relaxed frequencies. The workflow engine handles conditional branching, failure modes (`abort` / `skip`), and step chaining.

```bash
robothor engine workflow list      # List loaded workflows
robothor engine workflow run <id>  # Execute manually
```

## The Helm

Not a dashboard — a control plane. Built with Next.js 16 and Dockview for a paneled, IDE-like layout.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/helm-dashboard.png" width="800" alt="The Helm — control plane">
</p>

- **Chat** — Talk to agents through the Engine via SSE streaming
- **Task Board** — Kanban with drag-and-drop, approve/reject workflow
- **Event Streams** — Real-time feed from all Redis Streams
- **Agent Status** — Live health, run history, and error tracking
- **CRM Views** — Contacts, companies, conversations, notes
- **Service Health** — System topology with status indicators
- **Component Registry** — 20 lazy-loaded components, add your own

## The CRM

How agents coordinate. Native PostgreSQL tables — no external CRM dependency.

- **Task state machine** — TODO &rarr; IN_PROGRESS &rarr; REVIEW &rarr; DONE with full audit trail and SLA tracking
- **Agent notifications** — Typed messages between agents (task assigned, review requested, blocked, errors)
- **Cross-channel identity** — A single contact resolved across email, Telegram, voice, web, and API
- **Multi-tenancy** — Every table scoped by `tenant_id`. Bridge middleware enforces isolation.
- **Merge tools** — Deduplicate contacts and companies. Keeper absorbs loser's data, re-links all records.

## Memory

Three tiers of persistent memory, all local:

| Tier | Storage | Lifetime | Purpose |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| Working | Context window | Session | Current conversation state |
| Short-term | PostgreSQL | 48h TTL, auto-decay | Recent facts and observations |
| Long-term | PostgreSQL + pgvector | Permanent | Importance-scored, semantic search |

Facts are extracted from every input — email, calendar, conversations, vision events. Each fact carries a confidence score, category, entities, and lifecycle state. A knowledge graph of entities and relationships grows autonomously as the system ingests data.

```python
from robothor.memory.facts import store_fact, search_facts

# Store with confidence, category, and entity links
fact_id = await store_fact(
    fact={"fact_text": "Acme renewed for 2 years", "category": "deal",
          "confidence": 0.95, "entities": ["Acme Corp"]},
    source_content="email from sales",
    source_type="email",
)

# Semantic search across all facts
results = await search_facts("Acme contract status", limit=5)
```

**RAG stack:** Qwen3-Embedding &rarr; pgvector &rarr; Qwen3-Reranker &rarr; LLM generation. Fully local.

## Vision

Always-on camera monitoring with runtime mode switching:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Disarmed | Idle — no processing |
| Basic | Motion &rarr; YOLO &rarr; InsightFace &rarr; instant alerts + async VLM analysis |
| Armed | Per-frame tracking with full detection pipeline |

**Pipeline:** Motion detection &rarr; YOLOv8 nano (6 MB) &rarr; InsightFace ArcFace (300 MB) &rarr; pluggable alerts. Unknown persons trigger a snapshot to your chosen channel in under 2 seconds. Scene analysis via vision LLM (Ollama). Any RTSP camera source. Mode switch at runtime, no restart.
